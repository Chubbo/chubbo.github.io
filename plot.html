Whilst you are doing that, Trevor sets the charges on the vault door. Once he is back, use your phone’s remote function to detonate the charges.

Stay on the road and don’t attempt any cross-country shortcuts or the mission will end.</p>

From there, Lamar will trigger a short race, complete with several obstacles in the way. There are no checkpoint blips to follow, you will need to keep your eyes on Lamar as he zooms through traffic.</p>
                                                    <p>Use Franklin’s special wheelman ability to make the sharper turns. Doing this would enable time to go slow, but Franklins motion would still be razor sharp and help maneuver out of the sticky situations, and less of a chance of having a crash. Use Frank's ability several times to achieve the "Focused" requirement.</p>
                                                    <p>Continue to follow Lamar while steering clear of some of the obstacles that get in the way, especially vehicles that somehow block your way.</p>

                                                    <p>You will know that you won the race if Franklin arrives to the parking lot first. After you reach the drop point, you will be pursued by the police.</p>
                                                    <p>Evading them is relatively easy. a great hiding place would be under the freeway right behind the Vanilla Unicorn Strip Club (see screencap above). Wait for the wanted level to drop and continue on to Simeon's dealership.</p>
                                                    <p>When that is done, go outside and get into your car and drive back to the safehouse to complete the mission.</p></p>

He’s not in great shape, and if you push too hard he’ll begin to lose health. That being said, Jimmy is much slower, so just pedal towards the pier from any direction.</p>

                                                <p>
                                                    <p>If you decided to do the mission from Off-shore, there is one additional mission to accomplish: Trevor must break into Fort Zancudo and steal the giant Cargobob copter!</p>
                                                    <p>Make your way towards the Fort Zancudo area and you'll be presented with two ways to enter: directly from the front gate on the south or from the back gate on the north. For faster access, enter the fort from the northern section of the base (use the screencap to pinpoint the location to enter).</p>
                                                    <p>Smash through the gates and make a right turn towards the airfield. Ignore the soldiers shooting at you and keep driving towards the copter.</p>
                                                    <p>Quickly get out of the vehicle and run and jack the copter and fly outta there! A pursuing helicopter will chase after you and shoot missiles, so avoid it by flying forward (push the Left Analog stick upwards to make the copter fly downwards to gain speed).</p>
                                                    <p>Avoid any special flying maneuvers and just keep flying forward towards the ocean until the coast is cleared. From there, fly back to the airfield and land the copter to complete the mission!</p>

                                                    <p>After the opening cutscene, get into Franklin's car and drive over to the waypoint at the bridge over LS Docks. Drop off Franklin and then move towards the vantage point overlooking the freighter to start the mission.</p>
                                                    <h1>Part 2: Infiltration</h1>
                                                    <p>Before Michael can board the ship, position the Sniper Rifle over the heads of both of the guards on the upper deck. Snipe them with one shot and Michael will enter the ship.</p>
                                                    <p>When the perspective switches to Michael, plant the first bomb at the first pillar. From here, you can continue to plant bombs using Michael or you can switch to Franklin and assist Michael by sniping the guards.</p>
                                                    <p>For the Gold requirement, switch to Franklin and snipe guards with headshots. Keep the scope focused on the guards that are in the front near the stairways. Move the scope to the left and snipe the guards that are on the stairway and in the center mast.</p>
                                                    <p>Watch after Mike as he plants the second bomb. Keep moving towards the left and take out the guards on the stairwell and upper railings.</p>
                                                    <p>When the back side of the ship is cleared, Michael will enter the ship's cabins and end up triggering the alarm.</p>
                                                    <p>As the alarm wails, two Merryweather vehicles will show up near the ship. Snipe down the guards that come out of both vehicles and a chopper will fly in soon after. Shoot down the chopper pilot quickly to get back to defending Michael.</p>
                                                    <p>Snipe the guards that chase after Michael. Some will appear at the back of the ship and the others will be hiding in cover near the stairwell.</p>
                                                    <p>When the coast is cleared, Michael makes a run for it and dives out of the ship. From there, pull up your cellphone and choose the detonate option to blow up the freighter.</p>
                                                    <p>After Mike spots the item, the game switches to Trevor so pilot the submersible towards the item and pick it up.</p>

                                                    <p>When the mission begins, drive the trash truck to the waypoint to trigger a cutscene. After the cutscene, park the garbage truck horizontally so that it blocks both lanes of the street.</p>
                                                    <p>Once the armored car makes it stop, fly out of the alley and broadside it with the tow truck to start the robbery.</p>
                                                    <p>Get out of the tow truck and plant a Sticky Bomb on the back doors and then step away and detonate it.</p>
                                                    <p>Once that happens, police and SWAT will start arriving in droves. Start shooting them and aiming for their heads for headshots.</p>
                                                    <p>Shortly after a few cops are gunned down, more cops begin to swarm the alley behind Franklin. Move away from the front and get to cover in the back alley and start shooting at the incoming cops and SWAT. If you don't take these guys out, they will swarm behind Michael on the stairway and kill him, so keep an eye out!</p>
                                                    <h1>Part 2: Snipers on on the roof and A Chopper</h1>
                                                    <p>After several more baddies are down, Franklin gives the heads up about snipers on the rooftops. Switch to Trevor and snipe down the THREE SWAT agents on the adjacent rooftop.</p>
                                                    <p>Once all three snipers are down, switch back to Franklin and Michael and continue gunning down agents and officers from the front and the back alleyway until Trevor gives the heads up on an incoming chopper.</p>
                                                    <h1>Part 3: The Getaway</h1>
                                                    <p>With the chopper down, switch back between Michael and Franklin and continue to pick off any of the remaining officers and agents until Michael gives the green light to leave the area. Switch to Franklin and get into the trash truck and drive over to the getaway vehicle.</p>
                                                    <p>After you arrive at the getaway vehicle, park the trash truck a good distance away and then place a Sticky Bomb and detonate the truck. Drive away with the getaway vehicle and the game then switches to Michael. From there, drive up the hill to Devin Weston's house to complete the mission.</p>

                                                    <p>If you decide to do this mission as Franklin, the mission waypoint will be at the FIB lot in El Burro Heights.

When Trevor spots the first set of individuals, press the R1/RB button to listen in on their conversations.</p>
                                                    <p>After scanning the first set of people, the helicopter moves towards another section of town. The person that Trevor needs to find is all the way on the lower left side, so scan him to make the positive ID on Chad Mulligan.</p>
